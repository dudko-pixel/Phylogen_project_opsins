## PIA3

Modified from PIA2 (https://github.com/xibalbanus/PIA2).
Only tested in Ubuntu-based Linux systems but should work anywhere else with minimum adjustments in the installation process.

### Installation

This pipeline requires `Conda`. If it is not installed on your computer, you need to:

**1.** Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (look [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda) to decide which is right for you).

**2.** Run bash installation script like.
```commandline
bash Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
``` 
or 
```commandline
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

**3.** Source bashrc to activate conda.

```commandline
source ~/.bashrc
```

**4.**
`Mamba` and `Snakemake` are also required for pipeline running.

```commandline
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
conda create -n snakemake python=3.10.8
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake=7.25.0
```
Please be patient, if solving environment takes some time.

Activate *snakemake* conda environment.
```commandline
conda activate snakemake
```

**5.**
Download and unpack or clone PIA3 directory on your computer. PIA3 is installed as a separate conda environment during its first run. We recommend to run it on our test data.

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/AlenaKizenko/pia3_amphipod_opsins.git
cd pia3_amphipod_opsins/PIA3
```

Replace PATH/TO/PIA_ENV with preferred **full** path for your PIA3 environment.
```commandline
snakemake --cores 8 --use-conda --conda-prefix PATH/TO/PIA_ENV --conda-frontend conda --configfile config.yaml 
```
**6.** Run unit test.

```commandline
 python3 -m unittest test_PIA3.py
```

### Run the pipeline
For PIA3 run, you need to provide config.yaml file, in which all the requied parameters are stored. Please use only absolute paths to avoid an error.

Explanation of config-file fields:

* `in_dir`: path to folder with input reference `.fasta` file(s) **required**

* `out_dir`: output directory path **required**

* `db`: path to database **required**

* `transcripts`: **cds** - perform BLAST search only on coding sequences (longer than 1/2 of mean database sequence and starting with methionine); **all** use all sequences

* `clean`: delete intermediate files **default True**

* `model`: model for IQ-Tree maximum likelihood tree building (put **TEST** if not known)

* `outgroup`: outgroup for phylogenetic tree building; if not defined by user, first sequence from database FASTA file is taken

* `cd_h`: CH-HIT clustering treshhold (if 1 is chosen, CH-HIT clusters only identical sequences)

* `opsins`: check for retinal lysine in found sequences and output only opsins; NOTE: **RHO_Bos_taurus_AAA30674.1** sequence needs to be in the database file (can be found in `classification_opsins_full_aa.fasta`)
